            <h2>
                Why bother with culture?
            </h2>
            <p>
                It's a fair question. After all, isn't workplace culture a 'nice to have'?
            </p>
            <span class="mb-0">
                Not really...
            </span>
            <ul class="mt-0">
                <li>
                    Imagine never having to fight for top talent again.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Imagine knowing that your culture is so rock solid that your teams will effortlessly handle any challenge you throw at them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Imagine knowing that your leaders & managers are the very best in the business, and their teams are so loyal nobody <i>ever wants to leave</i>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Now <i>that</i> would be nice, wouldn't it?
            </p>

            <h2>
                But we run surveys...
            </h2>
            <p>
                It's defintely a start. However, instead of running quarterly pulse surveys that measure nothing more than how an employee feels on a particular day, you should instead be concentrating on getting the 7 fundamentals of workplace culture right.
            </p>
            <p>
                Youâ€™ll have a team who are aligned with the company values, committed to your mission & vision, and ready and willing to go that extra mile to produce the results you need to grow and scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                And what that <i>really</i> means is that you become known as the best company to work for, your teams are loyal and attracting great quality candidates becomes laughably easy.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, if you're ready to create a workplace culture that your teams will tell stories about, then let's talk.
